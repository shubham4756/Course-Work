By interacting closely with individual cats and observing their behavior, while it reduces stress in the cat, I have been able to help adopters figure out the type of animal that would be a good fit for their family and lifestyle (I have been involved with over 400 cat adoptions over two years).  By spending time with scared and/or shy cats, I have been able to bring them out of their shells and show potential adopters the way they might act in a home, which generally shortens the amount of time it takes for them to get adopted.  I spend approximately 20-30 minutes with each adopter answering questions or explaining particular animals, which a busy staff member often does not have time to do.    By interacting directly with over 100 young kittens (6-8 weeks old) and monitoring their weight, I have been able to pinpoint when a particular kitten starts losing weight or appears sick so early veterinary intervention can be taken.      Classroom Volunteer, Rocky Hill Elementary School, 2014-present    I have given guest lectures about spiders three times a year for the past two years to around 300 third-grade students.  I bring my own live and preserved research specimens for students and teachers to look at, observe, and feed to increase their awareness of the adaptations and importance of a commonly misunderstood animal.    KidsU Bugs Class Coordinator,  ​ University of Tennessee, June 2013-June 2015    Over a five-day period during the month of June, I taught 15-20 4th-8th grade students about ""bugs"" (insects and arachnids).  I spent two of the first four hours learning about different insects, watching documentary clips, and engaging in various active learning exercises before going outside to catch insects for their ""bug box"" project, which they got to take home at the end of the week.  This varied learning process allowed students to engage deeply with scientific material they might otherwise have avoided; by making the subject fun, the students left with a greater understanding of a largely avoided group of animals.      "

Extensively used SQL for accessing and manipulating database systems.  I have been Part of many of the Data-Integration projects.  Below are glimpse of few of them.  Project 1 : Teaming : In Ameriprise there was no explicit relationship between the advisors and the group to make sure the compensation is provided to the proper servicer and the admin manager or group leader.  Because of this Hierarchy issue many a times wrong advisors use to get compensated which use to result in lot of manual intervention as well as man hours.  As part of this project we not only established a proper hierarchy but we automated the process to save lot of money and man power Project 2 : HODS DB Re-Engineering: Ameriprise Financials spends millions of dollar every year on data storage and backup.  HODS is one of the biggest data store and growing ~ 1 TB every month.  Storage and backup cost were getting increased every month.  To reduce the storage & backup cost it required detailed analysis on the database design, backup strategy and application design.  As an SME, I recommended and presented my analysis, results, proposed solution and cost basis to the Ameriprise Leadership.  With the proposed solution 1/3rd of HODS storage and storage cost will be reduced.

I programmed an, impressive, block of code using PHP, JS and XML; including composing an exceptional instruction guide for the system developers at Yahoo, whom were able to apply the FTP and DB connections as required, for trouble free, integration in less than 15 hours.  Launching the finished application, pulled one snap shot image from eight different but local, security cameras.  Stored the images on a remote DB server then redirected the images to a web browser which displayed as one single image.  The images were to appear first as a thumbnail.  Clicking the thumbnail would enlarge the image, seamlessly, as one image; providing a constant updated, live image for viewing.  While completing this task, I developed a way to apply this framework to multiple brands of security cameras, providing N2N Secure, with a lucrative framework for future clients.  Succeeded in installing a working Windows 2012, Lenel Dashboard system which connected to a local AD and LDAP using a single sign on.

I am currently working on tearing off bits from our current monolithic C#.NET process and moving it into the cloud using a mix of Java, Python, and Node.js, as part of our overall directive to be microservice-focused.  I receive high praise for being self-directed and having foresight into where we should be going.  I also serve as a technical mentor for the team.  On my previous team I helped maintain a legacy applicant tracking system (ATS) written in PHP used by thousands of clients.  The system is especially difficult to understand and maintain since it uses a custom bloated framework and is littered with French comments and variables.  I was specifically responsible for implementing new features, bug fixes, and converting certain areas into a SOA where possible.  I was recognized as one of the top performing developers on my team.  Helped improve our deployment process which was incredibly ancient and difficult to maintain.  Deploying new code required a developer to spend upwards of several hours pushing out changes and monitoring systems to ensure stability.  Large changes that required migrations took even longer.  This legacy system was revamped to push out old versions of the system with greater efficiency which required only a few minutes of developer time.

Enhancements that I was responsible for implementing included the streamlining of onboarding new user accounts, adding automation that closed audit compliancy gaps and reduced the complexity involved in access changes throughout a user's account lifecycle.  Applications involved included vendor applications as well as in house applications installed locally as well as cloud based and SaaS applications such as Clarity and Microsoft Office 365.  These enhancements directly correlated to user productivity and IT resources needed to manage user accounts in the enterprise.  Utilizing my experience as an Identity Manager Training Instructor as well as documentation writer, I created and delivered targeted end user training sessions for the end user community at Discover on key enhancements to the Identity Management releases being rolled out.  This included creating end user quick guide documents, end user self-paced training modules and the technical documentation of support procedures.  Through this use of information published and presented to the end user community it increased productivity by giving the user community clear understanding in training as well as centralized reference material of how to use the features used to manage user access in the enterprise.  Utilizing my experience in project management, my involvement encompassed the change and release management in the delivery of new features.  My role here included the capturing and documenting requirements in a trace requirements matrix, designing a solid user acceptance plan, facilitated the user acceptance testing process, coordinating resources utilization, delivery of the release changes which included detailed change management implementation plans, implementation validation, release management of the changes and support turnover documentation.  My responsibilities included working with various business units in requirements gathering, vender resource collaboration, testing and implementation needed for enabling single sign on for the applications in that business unit utilizing CA Single Sign On.  Single Sign On for common applications in enterprise increased user productivity and reduced IT resources involved in account / password management.  The applications included vendor applications as well as in house applications installed locally as well as cloud based and SaaS applications such as Clarity and Microsoft Office 365.  This role encompassed the support and troubleshooting of user access across the identity and access management software as well as LDAP directories, virtual directories and Active Directory.  Additionally I was a key resource utilizing the Sailpoint Identity IQ governance software along with other team members for the configuration of applications to deliver automated certifications for critical applications in the enterprise thus automating many compliancy regulations and audit control requirements for those applications.         Pre-Sales Engineer / Principle Identity Delivery Specialist     Jan 2009   to   Jan 2010      Bickford Senior Living   －   Lansing Charter   ,      MI     Was instrumental in securing new opportunities in the role of a Pre-Sales Engineer demonstrating the key features of given solution aligned to customer needs then performing custom demonstrations of a given product set as applicable to the customer needs and finally responding to requests for proposals (RFPs), requests for information (RFIs) as requested by the potential customer/client.  Then once a customer engagement was secured, instrumental in creating a statement of work (SOW) for a multi-phased implementation of the solution for the customer.  Additionally, performed the roles of Identity Architect, Identity Project Lead, Lead Implementation Expert, Project Manager and Identity Management Training Instructor.  In 2009 the Identity practice at SimpleSoft Solutions, Inc.  was sold to Collier Computing Company.  In the Identity Management space I was the lead pre-sales engineer for Collier, driving initial product placement discussions, requirements gathering breakout sessions, coordinated stakeholder to gather and document requirements, creating product demonstrations, coordination of POC's, and responsible for the content of RFP and SOW related documents for the potential engagements.  In this role I was able to secure new Identity business for the company that spanned corporate, government and education sector clients.  Once an engagement in the Identity Management space started, my role often changed to that of the Identity Architect, lead implementer and often project manager.  I facilitated and coordinated the successful completion of several phases of a multi-phased Identity Management implementation for corporate, education and government sector engagements.  In each of these implementations the lifecycle management of user identities was centralized through the automation of user accounts and access in the enterprise.  These implementations included: onboarding / claiming of new accounts, changes in account access throughout the account lifecycle, concluding with the off boarding / sun setting the account and access in the enterprise.  The automation of the current process, which had previously been extremely manual in nature, greatly reduced the IT cost of managing user accounts.

Executed setup files and ran the setup wizard to initiate the install process.  Once the install completed then proceeded to configure the Web UI, created administrator accounts and activated scanners by registering them.  After successfully configuring scanners then downloaded latest plugins from Tenable support site.  Installed ForeScout CounterAct Enterprise Manager from IP address (http:// /install).   Ran setup wizard to complete the install.  Installed license during the install when it was available if not we would install license later in the management console.  After completion, logged into the management console to verify install and proceed with configuring the McAfee ePO plugin.  Installed and configured McAfee ePolicy Orchastrator by downloading the executable from McAfee's website.  Ran the set up wizard to configure the port numbers that needed to be opened for communication to McAfee's website and configured the registered license number purchased by client.  Once ePO was installed and configured I opened up the software manager to select with products to install on the endpoints.  Installed McAfee Agent onto the endpoints first so the endpoint can communicate with ePO.  Proceeded to install Virus Scan Enterprise, Endpoint Protection, and Solidcore.  Updated documentation in SharePoint with any new or relevant processes discovered during the installation and configuration.

Logged into Netbackup to verify backups are on schedule and are being completed.  If a backup failed, an error code will show up and it will give a generic description.  If the issue is a first level issue that can be solved, a trouble ticket is created in Remedy and the ticket gets updated with the steps that was taken to resolve the error code.  If more troubleshooting needs to be completed, the ticket will get assigned to the next level of support.  This helped keep track of the error codes that were being produced on a regular basis which helped with the troubleshooting process.         01/2015   to   07/2015     Help Desk Analyst    Toast   －   San Jose   ,      CA      Provided tier 1 support for Shire and Anthem Employees.

Users also called in to get support for Microsoft Outlook, VPN, iPhones, and printers.  Will do basic troubleshooting to determine the root problem.  Documented all troubleshooting steps in ServiceNow ticketing system.  If issue cannot be resolved during the first call, ticket will get assigned to the next level of support and user will the get transferred to that agent.  This helped keep track of all the calls that come in so the first call resolution number goes up.         06/2014   to   11/2014     Implementation Project Manager    Adp   －   Orlando   ,      FL      Handled multiple client implementations for the Allscripts 2014 Meaningful Use Package and Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS).

Stanford   ,      CA      My research at the Boston Children's Hospital was focused on studying molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying human immunological, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. It involved scientific as well as management components. Science  Identified target gene(s) involved in human primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs), inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and the modulation of immune responses.  Validated target gene(s) by designing, generation and phenotypic evaluation of global and tissue specific transgenic and knockout mouse models. This involved actively designing and successful execution of in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro experiments to assess the role of target gene under investigation.  Target genes studied and published: Lrrc8a, Slp-76, Wip, 3bp2, Cip-4, C3a, Tslp, Il-21r and Tlr-2. Management  Led immunology research activities to achieve program and project-level goals.  Planned and effectively communicated research goals and objective to junior scientific staff for the timely completion of research projects.  Designed, successfully performed and troubleshot experiments, interpreted data, and suggested next steps.  Presented data in-house and at various national and international scientific meetings in a variety of formats (oral, poster and panel discussion).  Contributed to the writing of SOPs, manuscripts and research grant proposals.  Managed day-to-day functioning of the laboratory.  Trained, supervised and mentored junior associates (research assistants, post-doctoral and clinical research fellows).  Introduced latest concepts/technologies such as PLA (Proximity Ligation Assay) and CRISPR- CAS to research programs in order to achieve research goals and objectives more efficiently.  Managed interactions with internal and external scientific collaborators in academia as well as biotechnology and contract research organizations. The above work led to three successful grants from the NIH and private agencies, the publication of 15 manuscripts in high impact journals, and training of several post-doctoral and junior technical staff.         Post-doctoral fellow     03/1998   to   06/2004      City Of Hope   Torrance   ,      CA      Led research projects aimed at the investigation of structure-function relationship of different signaling domains of adaptor proteins SLP-76 in the development and function of T cells and bone marrow derived mast cells (BMMCs). Successfully achieved the objectives of these projects by:  Designing and generating several different SLP-76 DNA expression constructs for the retroviral reconstitution of SLP-76 deficient BMMCs (derived from SLP-76 knockout mice). 1  Designing and generating a series of tissue specific wild type and different mutant SLP-76 transgenic mouse models and breeding them in to the SLP-76 knockout background.  In-depth phenotypic characterization of the reconstituted BMMCs and transgenic mouse models. The data generated in these studies resulted in one successful R01 grant from NIAID, NIH (for my mentor) and the publication of 3 manuscripts in high impact journals. LABORATORY TECHNIQUES AND SKILLS Generation, evaluation and use of specific antibodies  Designed target immunogenic peptides and prepared bacterial and mammalian cell expressed purified fusion proteins as immunogens, immunized mice and rabbits with immunogens for specific antibody response.  Evaluated antibody response by ELISA, Dot blot and Western blot assays.  Labeled purified specific antibodies with Biotin, FITC and PE to visualize antigen expression by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy and multi-color flow cytometric assays (by using BD LSR/Canto and LSR/Fortessa). Generation and evaluation of in vivo mouse models of human diseases  Designed, generated and phenotypically characterized transgenic SLP-76 mouse models to study the role of different domains of SLP-76 in human T cell development and function.  Designed, generated and phenotypically characterized LRRC8A knockout (regular and tissue specific conditional) mouse model to study its contribution in the development and function of hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic systems.  Established cell intrinsic role of LRRC8A in T cells development and function by generating and phenotypically characterizing Lrrc8a-/- hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplanted Rag2-/- radiation chimera mice.  Studied the role of SLP-76, 3BP2, CIP4 and LRRC8A in in vivo T cell function by eliciting and evaluating Th1 and Th2 specific hapten mediated contact hypersensitivity/delayed type hypersensitivity (CHS/DTH) in Slp-76-/-, 3bp2-/-, Cip4-/- and Lrrc8a-/- mice, respectively.  Investigated the role of TSLP, IL-21R and TLR-2 in allergic skin disease by developing OVA immunized mouse models of inflammatory allergic skin disease (atopic dermatitis) in Tslp-/-, Il- 21r-/- and Tlr-2-/- mice, respectively.  Investigated the role of C3a in eczema vaccinatum, a rare but severe adverse reaction to smallpox vaccination, by establishing vaccinia virus infection in C3a-/- mouse model of atopic dermatitis. Also, acquired extensive experience in working under BSL2+ safety conditions. Mammalian cell culture and cell-based (in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro) functional assays  Generated embryonic fibroblasts and bone marrow derived mast cells from wild type and Lrrc8a-/- mice.  Purified T and B cells from human and mouse by Miltenyi AutoMACS and FACS based cell sorting for cell signaling experiments.  Unraveled the role of SLP-76 and LRRC8A in T cell, B cell, Dendritic cell and NK cell function by evaluating Th-Differentiation, Cell Proliferation (by 3H incorporation and CFSE dye dilution methods), Cytokine Production (by FACS, ELSIA and RT-PCR), Activation Markers Expression (by FACS), Apoptosis (by FACS, TUNEL and Immunohistochemistry), Cell Cycle Progression (by FACS), and Cell Mediated Cytotoxicity (by 51Cr release assay). 2 Molecular biology, biochemical characterization and signal transduction techniques  Quantitatively evaluated gene expression profile in skin tissues, derived under regular and inflammatory experimental conditions, by real time quantitative PCR (for cytokines) and microarray (for global gene expression) analysis.  Established PCR and Southern blot based genotype-screening protocols for SLP-76 transgenic and LRRC8A regular and conditional knockout mice.  Participated in a collaborated project aimed at studying the role of LRBA in T cells responses. Helped in designing and testing of several candidate siRNA for the study. Additionally, designed CRISPR based DNA constructs for creating Lrba-/- mouse model.  Cloned tagged and untagged LRRC8A cDNA in its full length and truncated mutant forms in appropriate expression vectors for their expression in bacterial and mammalian cells (293T and Jurkat).  By using a series of pull-down and multi-color flow cytometry based ligand binding and competition functional assays, demonstrated that non-hematopoietic cells express LRRC8A ligand.  By using a series of immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE and Western blot assays, demonstrated that LRRC8A exist as a trimer and oligomer of higher order and act as a cell surface receptor.

Key Results: Architected a new feature where fine grained privilege classes were to be retrofitted to the product which other engineers implemented.  Led numerous design and implementation meetings.  Led a team of engineers during a high-profile onsite visit to an external company's proving ground.  Drove the team to achieve trip objectives through a five day around the clock effort.  Architected and built a sophisticated automated product build system that gave high visibility to the current state of development.  The 'nightly build' greatly freed up engineering time by automatically provisioning product packages that can easily be tested against and deployed, as well as providing developers with feedback if the code commits are valid on all supported (over 20) platforms.  Designed an IDL (Interface Definition Language) for remote procedure calls amongst modules written in different languages.  Wrote an IDL compiler to generate stubs in C/C++/Java.  This IDL was then used extensively in Backup Express and greatly accelerated product development by enabling the modules to easily communicate with each other.  Designed and implemented real-time multi-threaded transactional framework for implementing application logic atop a legacy database.  Designed and implemented an encryption/decryption and key management subsystem.  Designed and implemented a wizard like Java Swing application to automate device discovery and configuration.  Developed various utilities and tools using UNIX shell, Perl, Python, Ruby, MySQL, GNU make, lex/yacc.  Other job functions include interviewing candidates, customer support, requirement acquisition, usability engineering, and product build maintenance.          Education          PhD - Physics

He spun up faster than most engineers I've worked with. Within no time at all Dave was able to take on development stories and complete them faster then other team members. Dave has a wealth of knowledge a ton of different tech areas. He knows a lot of programming languages and frameworks. If he hasn't worked with a framework professionally he has probably played around with it in his free time. In addition to his technical knowledge Dave is also a great person to associate with. Very friendly, caring, always willing to help out and full of good ideas. I truly believe that Dave is one of the best engineers I've ever worked with in mycareer.

The gamble paid off. Dave is excellent. He is a quick learner. He is dependable. He is focused. Dave came to us as a PHP developer, which he still does. He has also started working more recently with Kotlin. Dave was always cheerful, and he accomplished everything that was asked of him. I would take a whole team of Dave's.

325,salesforce developer,"         SENIOR QUALITY ASSURANCE ENGINEER           Career Overview     I want to use the skills I have that help clients use your companies software to have complete success from the first time to the last time. I have always thought ""better the issue happens to us in testing than to the client"".  I want to help save jobs, save time, save our clients and have my employer to thank for it.       Qualifications        Quality assurance Application testing Writing test scripts Writing test plans Bug tracking Reporting defects Automated test cases Software development life cycle Maintaining test environments Manual testing CRM JIRA CRM Salesforce Quick Test Professional Unified Functional Testing SQL for reporting and queries HTML Error re-creation Agile test method Crystal reports VMWare Microsoft Office Microsoft Windows (Client/server) SOAPUI Computer Hardware Network Hardware EMR EHR Cisco VPN Checkpoint VPN Sonic Wall Intersystems Cache for reporting and queries Remote Desktop Terminal Services Active Directory RAID Cabling Network Topology Norton Ghost Microsoft Imaging (Windows 7) Backup Procedures Disaster Recovery Encryption Network security Server Migration ANSI Standards HIPAA Compliance DOS SOAPUI Time Management ADDITIONAL ABILITIES I have strong organizational skills. I have proven leadership ability. I have proven teaching skills. I am professional and courteous to both co-workers and customers. I have excellent skills in customer complaint resolution both face to face and on the phone. I hold a secret security clearance (inactive).                Work Experience      Senior Quality Assurance Engineer    July 2003   to   April 2015     General Motors   －   Roswell   ,      GA    An issue (error) or the need for new functionality (enhancement) was reported by one of our clients or found by me or another Netsmart associate. A ticket would be made using Salesforce (Support) or JIRA (Quality Assurance) containing as much detail as possible (screenshots, descriptions and all data that lead up to finding the issue). The priority of the ticket was decided and notated by the client, the support representative or project manager and on occasion my manager. The ticket would be assigned to a software developer for research and an update (patch/enhancement) would be made. The ticket would then be assigned to a senior developer for Senior Technical Review. The senior developer then assigned the ticket to me. I would read all the supporting documentation and work with the developer to verify my understanding of the issue and get their opinion about what needed testing peripherally. I would on occasion connect to the client using a secure VPN and check settings for re-creation purposes. There were registry settings, option settings, open or closed charges and other factors. I would then have to estimate the Level of Effort; how long it would take to bring the ticket to a complete close, having manually and later run through automated testing, pass and have registered, and then post the update to our company website. Next would be the Expected Release Date of the update. This was based on priority, backlog and the function that was being affected. I would write a complex, step by step test plan that would duplicate the issue. It would start with the product versions and the function the reporter was attempting when they discovered the issue. I would then duplicate the issue on my local machine by following my own test plan to verify accuracy (usually performed in a VMWare environment). I would create screenshots to illustrate the test plan and use fictional client data for HIPAA compliance. I would work closely with the developer, the support representative and occasionally the client to verify all my steps and the result. Then I would create a backup copy of the entire environment with the issue duplicated. I would then install the update using the product update option in the software or by command line in the database. When the install was complete I would check visibility of the update in the database and in the current server option of the product. I would check the spelling and the vocabulary the developer used for the name and the description of the update. I would check the tables and fields affected and/or any new tables for fields created by the update by visually checking and running queries against the tables using Crystal Reports. I would use my test plan to bring me to the back to the point of the issue. If the issue appeared resolved, I would take screenshots of the fixed issue and add them to the test plan. Check the tables again by refreshing my report and running the queries using the new data. I would then check other options that had any tie to the option with the issue to verify other issues were not created (manual testing). I took screenshots of those actions, but not necessarily add them to the test plan. I would keep them for myself since they did not have any direct reference to the original issue. I would again work closely with the support representative and the developer to verify the issue was resolved. If the update only fixed issues or stored data from the time of update install, I would verify with the developer that this was already being addressed. I would verify a new ticket was written to discuss if or how past entries would be corrected. I would then start the Automation software (It started with Hewlett Packard QTP, then later UFT). I would perform my test plan of the fixed option and the automation software would record my actions and turn them into a script. I would check the script for accuracy. When complete, I would send an e-mail to the staff advising this issue was being moved to the automated testing phase and change the ticket status to pending. I would put my test script in a specific folder on the network and move the unregistered version of the update to a specific folder on the network for the automation group. The process would usually take about 24 hours so I would finish the test plan and prepare the update release notes. The release notes gave all the particulars about the update (summary of the fix or enhancement, size, date created, created by and tested by). I would receive an e-mail back advising the script had been run (along with dozens of other scripts created by all the QA engineers for regression purposes). If no errors were created, I would mark the update as passed and send the ticket to the original developer who would register the update and assign the ticket back to me. The registration process added a list of updates that were required prior to installation (I would not need them during testing because my test area was always up to date prior to starting). I would list the required updates on the release notes, zip the registered update and the release notes together and post them on the company website for our client to install. The registered update would also be added to Netsmart's monthly and quarterly updates for customers. I would then close the ticket and assign it back to the original support representative to notify the client about the update. If the update did NOT fix the issue or if the update caused another issue, I would: Immediately document the result of the installed update. I would show the developer who made the update my findings. They would verify the update was not ready. I would send an e-mail to the group advising of the fail and to whom I was re-assigning the ticket. I would fail the update on the ticket and re-assign it to the developer who would then make other modifications. The process would start again until the update was complete, the issue fixed and passed through the proper workflow. On top of my normal workload: I instructed the interns and juniors about how to do ALL OF THE ABOVE. I would receive all updates involving EDI. This would include billing, remittance, eligibility denials and any other EMR/EHR. I was sent to client sites to teach themhow to use Avatar Electronic Data Interchange/Electronic Billing, Remittance, Eligibility, Denials and special reports. I spent weeks at client sites in Iowa, Pennsylvania, Upstate New York, Wyoming and West Virginia on special assignment. My first 5 years at Netsmart was assisting in its development. I would verify HIPAA compliance and I was the only QA engineer who knew how to create the electronic forms. I would work nights. I would work weekends. I would work holidays to keep the backlog to an absolute minimum. I was assigned to special projects for clients with special issues. I was assigned more than once to the Netsmart War Room. This was a room that contained the brightest and the best to handle a special needs client. Some clients needed customization added to the core product. Washington State was my special assignment. I had to keep a running copy of a single client completely up to date at all times to test the customization. New York State had special forms and billing requirements. It was my job to keep track of those as well.        Customer Service/IT Intern    January 1988   to   August 2002     Worldcom, Inc   －   City   ,     STATE    The company started out as Nationwide Cellular; a small re-seller of cellular phones. It was purchased by MCI sometime in the 1990's. MCI was then purchased by Worldcom. I started in an inbound call center handling customer calls. I took payments by phone, resolved disputes, handled cancellations and handled retentions to prevent cancellations. I handled low level 30 day delinquency issues, sometimes being forced to suspend customer service. I handled collisions. (Back in the analog phone days, a phone could be ""cloned"" fraudulently. We would set the phone to call us no matter what number the user called to advise and correct this). I assisted customers with rate plans, offered incentives of new equipment to raise their plans and to assist in retention. I later took a position as an intern in the IT department. The company moved from UNIX based dumb terminals to Microsoft PC's with Windows 98. I assisted in ""ghosting"" the PCs in a one week project. I then was responsible for changing the retail outlet computers to the new PCs and instructed the sales staff on how to use them. I would perform troubleshooting, virus removal, BSODs and any other Windows 98 related issues. I was promoted to IT representative in 2000 and was assigned a mentor (Rudolph Paetz). I was responsible for server maintenance, shown the proper IT notations and documentation. I replaced workstations and peripheral equipment. I replaced wall outlets and replaced cabling. I installed and re-installed UNIX client software and connected it to the server.        72E Mobile Combat Encrypted Communications Specialist Grade    November 1981   to   November 1987     United States Army Reserve Signal Corps   －   City   ,     STATE    I was responsible for running a message center in combat conditions.

MS  ,   State       Leading a small UI team to create retirement tools for our participants to help better predict their future retirement outcomes.  The applications that we have deployed have led to a 25% increase in users retirement contributions, accomplishing our goal of helping our users' retirement readiness.  At Putnam I have been leading a team of developers to create and maintain jQuery, Backbone, and now Angular applications.  Accomplishments while at Putnam include bringing the site up to more modern standards while still support browsers as old as IE7.  For example updating the libraries like jQuery from 1.3 to 1.10+, and moving the HTML away from table layouts to more modern div layouts.  This upgrades lead to improvements in overall performance of the site and reduced the quirks we were having in the oldest and newest browsers.  I strived to reduce issues in QA by making sure the team was properly informed of requirements, and supported so that they could focus on the task at hand.  I lead an initiative to improve documentation with Markdown documents and api generation through JSDoc.  Our team always had a small contingent of contractors that would come and go and reducing their learning curve greatly improved our process.

To manage our collaborative efforts we used Subversion and Trac for task management.  Using the PureMVC framework we were able to create a new community site for the client's customers, which gave them an informative and interactive environment to socialize and improve their golf game.  Working on another small development team we created an enterprise AIR application in Flex Builder 3.0 using the Cairngorm framework.  The new application updated their current application from a COBOL application to the new AIR desktop application.  The application is a suite of business management software for metal manufactures which can manage every step of the business process from inventory management to customer relations.  This provides customers with an SAP alternative that is more cost efficient and specifically tailored to their industry.

We used Subversion SVN and Jira to collaborate our efforts, communicate our project goals with each other, and the client on desired changes to the application.  I utilized various design patterns and MVC (Modelviewcontroller) frameworks such as Tango and Cairngorm to give the clients ease of flexibility and maintenance for the future of their applications.          Mar   07/2005   －   12/2005     Partnership Erie     City   ,     STATE       Created professional quality websites for nonprofit organizations that were easily.  maintainable.

Extensive knowledge of Java Development and Object Oriented Design and Programming.       Highlights          Team Leadership  Requirements gathering  OO modeling/design  Agile development techniques  System Design and Development      Java  Spring/Spring MVC/Spring WS  Hazelcast  Twitter Bootstrap  SQL  JUnit, Powermock/Mockito            Accomplishments     Developed unified build system that creates a versioned DAG of dependencies for various languages (C++, Java, Python, R, JS Web applications) and builds and packages all the required components for easy deployment of a single release element.  The system allows builds for different languages across different platforms, including Windows, Solaris and Linux Red Hat 5 and 6.   Implemented a SAML based SSO solution for internal and external facing web applications.   Lead the iShares team for 1 1/2 years, reducing the size of the code base by over 70% without losing any existing functionality while adding new functionality at the same time.  Updated the code base from 0% unit test coverage to over 80% coverage during this time.       Experience      Lead Software Engineer    February 2009   to   December 2015     Deloitte   -   Arlington   ,      VA      Developed a unified Build System to allow language agnostic compilation and packaging of applications.  The tool is a multi-threaded application that creates a graph of direct and transient dependencies and performs necessary operations on them, including checking out from various source control systems, compiling and packaging.  The tool is optimised to only perform operations when changes occur.  The front end dashboard, called Build Server, utilizes an embedded Jetty,  Twitter Bootstrap, Spring MVC and Hazelcast to distribute builds across a number of servers and aggregate build data into distributed build objects for view.  Hazelcast handles both the distributed object data and a set of queues and listeners for distributing the build requests.   Developed a SAML based SSO platform used by internal and external applications.  In implementation of this system, I worked closely with our security team to ensure both our registration and login pages are secure and that our encryption mechanisms are secure.  We set up WebServices to retrieve user information both from the web and from our mobile iOS applications.  Worked closely with various development teams for application integration and data migration into our registration platform.   Test coverage of this system was 93% at the time I moved away from the project.   Directly managed other developers on various projects, primarily on the iShares North America and iShares Latin America web teams.  I lead development of the Latin American iShares web sites and created a unified code base between various web sites that were currently in production when I began.  This included the iShares US, Brazil and Mexico sites, and later the Chile and Europe sites.  I also led the iShares North America web development team for 1 1/2 years during which time I worked closely with the business team to develop requirements, documentation of the web sites, and also with data and QA teams to ensure high data and site quality.  I coded both back-end Java architecture and components and front end jsps and web components.  Development projects include restyling of web site for the  iShares team with completely rewritten front end code and redesigned and optimized back end code, with new code for a number of new services.  The front end uses a number of different technologies, including Ajax, Flex, JSP and OO javascript.  We also wrote a number of widgets for front end reuse for graphs and charts among other things.  I wrote a back end based rules engine that drives how the various pages are configured based on fund data.          Senior Software Engineer    January 2008   to   January 2009     Livongo Health, Inc.   -   Atlanta   ,      GA      I was in charge of designing, building and maintaining server side Java components for an educational software company.    During this time, I participated in product team meetings to determine direction for server side development team. as well as worked on various development projects.  I wrote a transactional archiving tool which was runnable through JBoss JMX and the command line.    The tool archives takes source and destination locationsand uses ssh to move the files.    The tool allows for restoring files from archive when needed by audit.  This tool used a transaction table with heavy indexing to improve efficiency as millions of files were archived at a time.   I also updated the reporting data from Hibernate 2 to Hibernate 3 for better integration into JBoss and with Spring, better session factory management, greater efficiency (faster querying), and stronger bean definitions.    This upgrade involved upgrading JBoss and rewriting most of the queries.    I wrote and maintained the front and back end of the reporting system, that reads and reports on student data from a large number of institutions.    This provides custom web pages for institutions to view their data, maintain their accounts and run custom reports on their students.    As part of the reporting system, I wrote a complex graphing system for displaying these student reports.    I also wrote a web service to handle login credential verification and push user data to the report clients.

Worked on a project with 2 week iterations developed across 4 different timeframes (SF, UK, Japan and AU), leading development of messaging and data access components.  The application was a workflow engine to handle client orders.  I created Spring web services to handle order state management as part of the flow.  The code was well unit test covered using JUnit, Mockrunner and EasyMock.  Lead the development of messaging and data modeling between the data warehouse system and various data providers using JUnit tests to ensure quality of components.

435,ios developer,"         LEAD SOFTWARE ENGINEER           Summary     Software Engineer offering 19 years in the IT industry with a focus on product design and development. Extensive knowledge of Java Development and Object Oriented Design and Programming.       Highlights          Team Leadership  Requirements gathering  OO modeling/design  Agile development techniques  System Design and Development      Java  Spring/Spring MVC/Spring WS  Hazelcast  Twitter Bootstrap  SQL  JUnit, Powermock/Mockito            Accomplishments     Developed unified build system that creates a versioned DAG of dependencies for various languages (C++, Java, Python, R, JS Web applications) and builds and packages all the required components for easy deployment of a single release element.  The system allows builds for different languages across different platforms, including Windows, Solaris and Linux Red Hat 5 and 6.   Implemented a SAML based SSO solution for internal and external facing web applications.   Lead the iShares team for 1 1/2 years, reducing the size of the code base by over 70% without losing any existing functionality while adding new functionality at the same time.  Updated the code base from 0% unit test coverage to over 80% coverage during this time.       Experience      Lead Software Engineer    February 2009   to   December 2015     Deloitte   -   Arlington   ,      VA      Developed a unified Build System to allow language agnostic compilation and packaging of applications.  The tool is a multi-threaded application that creates a graph of direct and transient dependencies and performs necessary operations on them, including checking out from various source control systems, compiling and packaging.  The tool is optimised to only perform operations when changes occur.  The front end dashboard, called Build Server, utilizes an embedded Jetty,  Twitter Bootstrap, Spring MVC and Hazelcast to distribute builds across a number of servers and aggregate build data into distributed build objects for view.  Hazelcast handles both the distributed object data and a set of queues and listeners for distributing the build requests.   Developed a SAML based SSO platform used by internal and external applications.  In implementation of this system, I worked closely with our security team to ensure both our registration and login pages are secure and that our encryption mechanisms are secure.  We set up WebServices to retrieve user information both from the web and from our mobile iOS applications.  Worked closely with various development teams for application integration and data migration into our registration platform.   Test coverage of this system was 93% at the time I moved away from the project.   Directly managed other developers on various projects, primarily on the iShares North America and iShares Latin America web teams.  I lead development of the Latin American iShares web sites and created a unified code base between various web sites that were currently in production when I began.  This included the iShares US, Brazil and Mexico sites, and later the Chile and Europe sites.  I also led the iShares North America web development team for 1 1/2 years during which time I worked closely with the business team to develop requirements, documentation of the web sites, and also with data and QA teams to ensure high data and site quality.  I coded both back-end Java architecture and components and front end jsps and web components.  Development projects include restyling of web site for the  iShares team with completely rewritten front end code and redesigned and optimized back end code, with new code for a number of new services.  The front end uses a number of different technologies, including Ajax, Flex, JSP and OO javascript.  We also wrote a number of widgets for front end reuse for graphs and charts among other things.  I wrote a back end based rules engine that drives how the various pages are configured based on fund data.          Senior Software Engineer    January 2008   to   January 2009     Livongo Health, Inc.   -   Atlanta   ,      GA      I was in charge of designing, building and maintaining server side Java components for an educational software company.

I wrote a transactional archiving tool which was runnable through JBoss JMX and the command line.    The tool archives takes source and destination locationsand uses ssh to move the files.    The tool allows for restoring files from archive when needed by audit.  This tool used a transaction table with heavy indexing to improve efficiency as millions of files were archived at a time.   I also updated the reporting data from Hibernate 2 to Hibernate 3 for better integration into JBoss and with Spring, better session factory management, greater efficiency (faster querying), and stronger bean definitions.    This upgrade involved upgrading JBoss and rewriting most of the queries.    I wrote and maintained the front and back end of the reporting system, that reads and reports on student data from a large number of institutions.    This provides custom web pages for institutions to view their data, maintain their accounts and run custom reports on their students.    As part of the reporting system, I wrote a complex graphing system for displaying these student reports.    I also wrote a web service to handle login credential verification and push user data to the report clients.

Created general documentation which included documenting an overview of Nortel connectivity to help fellow employees, VCRSsupport overview - Created overview documentation on support activities and discussed with fellow workers, DisasterRecovery DRILL which gave support personnel from other groups an overview of the Disaster Recovery process.  Disaster Recovery, I was the lead / point of contact for my departments disaster recovery exercise.  Each year Verizonperforms a disaster recovery exercise simulating a disaster where applications would need to fail over to their disaster recovery server.  This exercise is monitored and each application is tracked against its desired goals.  This exerciseinvolved bringing down our Dataguard link which keeps our production database in sync with our disaster recovery database.  Configurations are made to property / config files to point to the DR database and the application is broughtup.  Testing is performed to insure we are able to connect, retrieve and update data on the DR database.  After testing hasbeen completed and it is verified that there are no database issues, we then contact our third party vendors ( Syniverse,IConnectiv (aka Telecordia), eTNI) and test receiving/transmission of files between Verizon and our external vendors.Outside of the annual DR exercise test, I attended daily/weekly meetings held prior to and during execution of ourdisaster recovery test.  After the test, I provide the necessary documentation verifying our applications successfulexecution.  I also maintained our application DR Documents providing detailed information with the intent to helpfollowing years execution runs smoother.  In the documentation, I include information needed to configuration files, highlevel overview of the exercise and detailed information on the tasks required to accomplish our application testing objectives.
